## Random Notes ðŸš€

This repository serves as an archive for random notes I take when I build
projects. I mostly used Notion for note-taking, but I've come to like writing
them in code using my code editor. I mostly write these notes in comments.
Therefore, this repository contains code files that are mostly just comments.

## Commits

Commits to this repository are random and do not reflect any sort of tracking or
progress. Also, it contains all my notes across several projects, not just a
particular one. Take them with a grain of salt.

## What's with the config files

I started the repo as a fork of one of my templates, which contains config files
for a TypeScript package setup, and that's why there are config. I didn't remove
them because I like to see them anyway ðŸ˜….

## Take a look

If you want, you can take a look at the files to see what the notes are like; You might get an idea. They are just a simple way for me to keep track of things, and I like writing them ðŸ¤ª.

Thanks for reading.
