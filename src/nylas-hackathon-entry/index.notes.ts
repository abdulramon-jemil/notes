 * --------------------------------------
 * + They don't include companies that aren't popular (with unknown data).
 * + For companies that don't accept email reclaims (according to them), they
 *   just give a link to one of the company's pages e.g. the privacy policy
 *   page. Once the link is clicked, they assume the data is reclaimed and
 *   remove it from the list of companies.
 * + They don't allow modifying of email template used to make reclaim request.
 * + They don't allow to mark specific companies as reclaimed manually.
 *
 * TYPES OF RECLAIMS
